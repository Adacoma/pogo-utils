/**
 * @file flash_file.h
 * @brief Small, bounded named-file catalog over Pogobot user flash.
 *
 * PFFS v3 uses all 5888 SDK user-flash pages. Sixteen catalog pages in
 * separate erase sectors contain five slots each. Stable file IDs 1..80 map
 * directly to those slots, so ID lookup still reads one catalog page. Files
 * occupy contiguous pages and own every 4 KiB sector that they intersect.
 * Human-readable names are optional metadata; IDs are the persistent identity.
 *
 * The fast reader checks structural bounds but deliberately skips CRC checks.
 * The secure reader checks the catalog CRC and the CRC of every ordinary file
 * page. Append-only flash logs use their own per-page CRC reader instead.
 * Replacement erases and rewrites the file's dedicated sectors. Catalog changes
 * erase and rewrite only the selected catalog sector. Mutations, including
 * defragmentation, are not transactional: interrupted writes cannot be rolled
 * back.
 *
 * On-flash page numbers are relative to the SDK user-flash region:
 *
 *   pages 0,16,..240  catalog pages, one per dedicated erase sector
 *   pages 256..5887  data extents, rounded up to complete erase sectors
 *
 * There is no heap allocation, directory tree, variable-length byte stream,
 * automatic compaction, or implicit open-file state. A "file page" is one physical
 * 256-byte page. That restriction is deliberate: callers can keep one page
 * buffer and the fast reader can resolve an ID with two physical reads.
 *
 * Public functions are synchronous. They do not lock the flash peripheral and
 * must not be interleaved by concurrent callers for the same robot. Returned
 * metadata is decoded into ordinary host values; callers never receive pointers
 * into a temporary catalog buffer.
